title: PauseAI values & strategy
description: How does PauseAI plan to achieve its mission?

## What do we want?

Globally halt frontier AI development until we know how to do it safely and under democratic control. See our [proposal](/proposal).

## What are our core values?

- **Community**. A feeling of community doesn't just come from a shared goal (e.g. pausing AI) or values, but also from social activity. That's why it's important to get people to meet, organize events, have social gatherings and create IRL friendships. It's not just about constructive action, it's about making friends and feeling at home with a group.
- **Anyone can contribute.** Many AI safety / AI governance organizations rely solely on their group of paid employees. This has its merits, but it leaves a gap of volunteers. That's where PauseAI is different. By fostering volunteers and encouraging action we can get stuff done even without a lot of funding.
- **Transparency by default.** Do and discuss things publicly and openly, unless there's a good reason not to. Meetings are open to join, the website is open source, and the Discord server is joinable. Being approachable lowers the barrier to feel welcome and help out.
- **Honesty.** Because we don't have any weird incentives (e.g. having a stake in an AI company) we are free to say what is needed. Because we are seen as activists, we should be less concerned than other AI safety organizations about being perceived as extreme. We still have to think about what we say and how that affects the world, but we should not fear our funders pulling their cash away if we speak our minds.
- **Diversity in risks, uniformity in desires.** Whether you're worried about x-risk, cybersecurity hazards or the impact of AI on our democracy: we are unified in our desire to pause AI development.
- **No partisan politics**. Humans are tribal creatures, which causes us to bundle viewpoints into groups (left/right). AI safety is not partisan, and we want to keep it that way. We do not let our other political views distract us from our combined goal.

## What type of culture do we want to foster?

- **Friendly**. We want to be a group that people like to be part of. We want to be welcoming to new members.
- **Open**. We want to be open to new ideas, new people, new ways of doing things. We want to be open to criticism. Our goal is to prevent AI risks. We should be open to the possibility that we're wrong about how to do that.
- **Action-oriented**. We want to be a group that gets stuff done. The perfect is the enemy of the good. We cannot give in to the comfort of just talking about things. We need to act.
- **Reasonable**. Because our concerns are often dismissed as crazy, we need to be extra careful to not _look_ crazy. Emphasize that many people in our group have technical backgrounds. Show that we know what we're talking about.
- **Grassroots**. We're not funded by big corporations. We're concerned citizens, we're volunteers. The conspiracies about X-risk being pushed by companies need to be proven wrong.

## Who are we trying to convince?

- **Politicians**. This is the group that ultimately matters most. Political leaders are the only ones who can implement the treaty that we're asking for. We reach out to them directly (e.g. through e-mails and meetings) and indirectly (through articles, social media, word of mouth, voting behavior).
- **Journalists.** Politicians and the public read what journalists write. A protest can only reach the people who are physically there. A journalist can reach way more. This is why we write a press release when we protest (there's a [whole document on how](https://pauseai.info/writing-press-releases)).
- **The public**. We interact directly with the public through protests, events, flyering, etc. This has multiple goals: get more people to think about AI risks, and recruit new members. This last part is important because we need to grow our group to be able to do more things.

## Which actions are most important?

- **Peaceful protests**. Protests are shown to be effective in increasing public awareness and support. They are also a great way to recruit new members and improve community feeling.
- **Sending e-mails to politicians**. Directly reaching out to decision-makers and representatives is one of the most effective ways of making an impact on policy.
- **Fun social activities**. This might sound not very impactful, but movements grow through friendships. We need to have a good time together so people want to come back and bring their friends.
